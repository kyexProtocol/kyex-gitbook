# How It Works

To earn points from swap transactions, users must complete swaps that are fully processed through our smart contract. By default, for every USD $1 worth of swaps made, you earn 6 points for the complete trade.

For example: Swapping USD $100 worth of POL to USD $XXX of BNB

Swap Computation: $100 x 6 = 600 points earned

Scenario: User A uses 5,000 USDT to buy BTC (Earns 5,000 x1x6 = 30,000 points), and sells ETH to get 5,000 USDC (Earns 5,000 x1x6 = 30,000 points). In total User A will receive 60,000 points which will be shown on the points webpage.

Daily Sign-in Points: Daily sign-in points are accrued by signing in to KYEX on a weekly basis, from Monday 0:00 AM until Sunday 11:59 PM (UTC). You can earn 310 points for signing in consistently for one week.
