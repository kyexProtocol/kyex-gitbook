# ABOUT KYEX

Currently, KYEX is a Decentralized Exchange (DEX) optimized from the ground up. The vision is a fully on-chain, fully transparent trading platform, with applications and features truly built for crypto users. KYEX champions the essence of blockchain, pushing the boundaries of transparency, true decentalization, and full user ownership, all without compromising end user experience.

KYEX sets out to build an entire ecosystem of permissionless financial applications – every possible profit-taking trading facility (Perpetual Futures, DeFi Yield Farming, etc.), as well as asset acquisition facility (Seamless Cross-chain Swap w/ Limit Orders & Auto-DCA, etc.), all of which would be completely powered by proprietary smart contracts to ensure that every mode made by users are 100% on-chain with no intermediaries, and every move made by KYEX is openly viewable by anyone. While other exchanges are out there are focused on Know-Your-Customer (KYC) procedures, KYEX pushes for its users to Know-Your-Exchange (KYEX).

Every component of KYEX and its products adopt multi-layered solutions, from pricing oracle systems, to liquidity models. Multi-layered pricing oracle systems ensures that KYEX is tamper-proof, backed up by the immutable nature of our audited smart contracts. Multi-layered liquidity models mean that liquidity health on KYEX is double-bolstered, significantly reducing risks of lack-of-liquidity, heightening the safety of users’ funds in user-incentivized liquidity pools, as well as building deep liquidity.

For now, KYEX’s flagship product is a fully onchain, Seamless Cross-chain Swap, complete with Limit Orders functionality, as well as an Auto-DCA functionality, dubbed the Allswap. Future developments include a fully on-chain order book Perpetuals exchange, a platform utility & governance, permissionless liquidity, permissionless listing of assets for Perpetuals trading, etc.
