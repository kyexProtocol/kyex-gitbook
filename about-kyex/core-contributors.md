# Core Contributors

The team used to do physical trading of commodities, banking & fund management, etc. before getting into DeFi in 2021. Being well connected, through networking and communications, the team found that existing platforms in the market were too biased towards themselves, more often than not leaving users on the shorter end of the stick, such as the lack of transparency, users unknowingly giving up full control of their own funds, price manipulation to hunt for stop-losses and force liquidations, etc.

In November 2022, the market clearly, and unfortunately, witnessed what damage that can bring about, as seen with FTX. Many platforms out there also have development outsourced, or have their source codes bought over from third-parties, some white-labelled as well, before being packaged as a bespoke, proprietary platform, with bad tech filled with loopholes. Most of these platforms were also founded by teams who arenâ€™t crypto traders who are as neck-deep into DeFi as their users are. Teams of businessmen who are in it for the money. This always leads them towards failing to accurately judge what is good UX, and what is not.\
\
As such, the KYEX team set out to build a product that could solve these issues and provide users with a seamless trading experience.

The team actively engages with and listens to the community; you are welcome to join the[ ](https://discord.gg/hyperliquid)community to ask any questions and share feedback. KYEX takes all forms of feedback constructively, and encourages for its users to work together with the team to build KYEX to the best that it can be.
